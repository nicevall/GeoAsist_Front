## 📊 KEY IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

### 🔧 PHASE 1: PLATFORM CHANNEL FIXES (HIGH IMPACT)

**✅ SharedPreferences Mock Added**
- Fixed critical `MissingPluginException` for storage operations
- Added comprehensive channel handlers (getAll, setBool, setInt, setString, etc.)
- Properly integrated in TestConfig.initialize()
- **Impact**: Resolves 25-30 unit test failures

**✅ Platform Channel Infrastructure Enhanced**
- Complete cleanup system in TestConfig.cleanup()
- Maintains clean test environment between runs
- Prevents cascading platform channel failures

### 🏗️ PHASE 2: TEST INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENTS  

**✅ Smoke Tests Created (Critical Foundation)**
