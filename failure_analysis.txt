=== COMPREHENSIVE TEST FAILURE ANALYSIS ===

SMOKE TESTS: âœ… 9/9 PASSED (100%)
UNIT TESTS: 83 passed, 54 failed (60.6% success)
WIDGET TESTS: 65 passed, 17 failed (79.3% success)

CURRENT OVERALL STATUS:
Total Tests: 228
Passed: 157  
Failed: 71
Success Rate: 68.9%
Improvement from 59% baseline: 9.9 percentage points
Target: <20 failures, Current: 71 failures

=== FAILURE CATEGORIES IDENTIFIED ===

1. PLATFORM CHANNEL ISSUES (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - MissingPluginException for shared_preferences
   - MissingPluginException for platform channels
   - HTTP client warnings in test environment
   
   Examples:
   - "No implementation found for method getAll on channel plugins.flutter.io/shared_preferences"
   - Platform channel mocks not covering all required channels
   
2. PROVIDER ACCESS ISSUES (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Some widget tests failing due to provider context issues
   - Navigation-related provider conflicts
   
3. MOCK CONFIGURATION ISSUES (MEDIUM PRIORITY) 
   - Singleton behavior inconsistencies in unit tests
   - Instance comparison failures
   - Performance statistics not initializing properly
   
   Examples:
   - "Expected: <Instance of 'AsistenciaService'> Actual: <Instance of 'AsistenciaService'>" 
   - LocationService performance statistics failing: "Expected: <true> Actual: <false>"

4. WIDGET TEST NAVIGATION ISSUES (LOW PRIORITY)
   - MapViewScreen security redirections causing test failures
   - Navigation argument validation causing widget not to render
   
   Examples:
   - "ðŸš¨ ACCESO DIRECTO NO PERMITIDO - Redirigiendo a validaciones"
   - "Found 0 widgets with type 'MapViewScreen'"

5. TEST FRAMEWORK CONFIGURATION (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Some tests creating HttpClient unnecessarily
   - Warning: "At least one test in this suite creates an HttpClient"

=== IMPACT ASSESSMENT ===

HIGH IMPACT FIXES (Will fix ~40 tests):
- Platform channel mocks completion (shared_preferences, etc.)
- HTTP client mock configuration for test environment

MEDIUM IMPACT FIXES (Will fix ~20 tests):
- Provider access safety in widget tests  
- Mock service singleton behavior corrections

LOW IMPACT FIXES (Will fix ~10 tests):
- MapViewScreen test parameter configuration
- HttpClient warning elimination

=== RECOMMENDED FIXING PRIORITY ===

PHASE 1: Platform Channel Mocks (Highest ROI)
- Add shared_preferences mock to TestConfig
- Add missing platform channel handlers
- Configure HTTP mock for test environment

PHASE 2: Provider Access Safety  
- Update widget test helpers with try-catch provider access
- Ensure provider contexts are properly established

PHASE 3: Mock Service Improvements
- Fix singleton instance comparison issues
- Initialize performance statistics properly in mocks

PHASE 4: Widget Test Parameter Fixes
- Configure MapViewScreen test parameters correctly
- Add proper navigation argument setup

ESTIMATED OUTCOME AFTER FIXES:
- Target Success Rate: >85%
- Target Failures: <15 tests
- Current: 68.9% success, 71 failures
- Post-fixes: ~85-90% success, 10-15 failures
